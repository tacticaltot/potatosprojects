My WIP attempt to use OpenCV and python to make a webcam accurately read an absolute encoder (http://codeforfree.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/1/6/10160088/2176613_orig.jpg), which gives a very accurate angle measurement (sub 1 degree). I plan to run it with a raspberry pi and hook up a cheap laser distance measurement module (https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-GLM-35-Measure-120-Feet/dp/B00VI7WBWE) to make a total station/theodelite. Considering total stations often run for 10k+ used, if this provides any level of accuracy I will consider it a success.
